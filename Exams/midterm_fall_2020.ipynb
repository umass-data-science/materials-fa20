The maximum score for late exams will be reduced by 1 letter grade per 3 hours of lateness with a maximum lateness penalty of three letter grades.  Exams turned in more than 24 hours late will receive no credit.\n",

    "Answer each question using only one cell.  You may create a copy of this notebook and open additional cells for testing, but when you turn in the exam, please only have one cell per question.  Partial credit will be given.  It is easier to give partial credit if you comment your code to say what each line is doing, or trying to do.  If you can't solve a problem fully, try solving part of it for partial credit.\n",
